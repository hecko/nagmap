Intro
=====
NagMap project is an initiative to create super-simple application to integrate Nagios with Google
maps. The integration aims to visualize current status of network devices on aerial photography
images. It also aims to give administrator basic information on devices to do further investigation of their
status, such as links to MRTG and Smokeping pages of respected devices.

If you experience any problems deploying NagMap please send an email to maco@blava.net - I will do my best
to assist you or to add new features into NagMap. 

NagMap is now hosted on github.com
NagMap ses Google Maps API v3

NagMap calls Home!
==================
NagMap calls home (our development server) every time it is used (index.php is called
on your installation)! This is only and only for developers to know which versions of
NagMap are being used worldwide and also for you to know whether there is a
new version of NagMap available! No other data are being stored ANYWHERE and
are not mined for any information.

If you want to disable the calling script please change the line in index.php:
include('./call.php');
to
# include('./call.php');
The calling script will be completely disabled.
