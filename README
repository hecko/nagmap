I am marking this project dormant - please see here for newer codebase: https://github.com/jocafamaka/nagmapReborn

Intro
=====
NagMap project is an initiative to create super-simple application to 
integrate Nagios with Google maps. The integration aims to visualize 
current status of network devices on aerial photography images. It 
also aims to give administrator basic information on devices to do 
further investigation of their status, such as links to MRTG and 
Smokeping pages of respected devices.

If you experience any problems deploying NagMap please 
send an email to maco@blava.net - I will do my best
to assist you or to add new features into NagMap. 

NagMap is now hosted on github.com
