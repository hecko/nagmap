Nagios Configuration
====================
The 'notes' field for host definition in Nagios needs to match the following example:
  latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136

If you are editing Nagios configuration files by hand this is how the FULL notes line should look like:
  notes       latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136

You can get the precise coordinates from Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) - right click on 
the spot where your device is located and select option "What's here?". The coordinates will be set 
in maps search bar. 

To draw connections, hosts need to have 'parents' field set up in Nagios / Icinga.

Apache / Nagmap setup
=====================
Your webserver (e.g. Apache) needs to have PHP support enabled!
Please make sure your PHP is version 5.3 and above :) (see phpinfo() php function)
This app is mostly tested on PHP version 5.3.6 on Ubuntu Linux.

On some distributions you might need to install mbstring for PHP - like Fedora / RedHat:
yum install php-mbstring

1) copy the nagmap directory into your Apache web folder
   (/var/www/ on Debian/Ubuntu, or /var/www/html/ on RedHat/CentOS)

2) edit config.php file to fit your needs

3) Open the website of nagmap installation (e.g. open Firefox - point to http://www.youwebserver.org/nagmap )

When not working as expected, send the source code of the website (Ctrl-U in Firefox) to maco@blava.net for support :)
