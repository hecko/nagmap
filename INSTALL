Nagios Configuration
====================
The 'notes' field for host definition in Nagios needs to match the following example:
  latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136

If you are editing Nagios configuration files by hand this is how the FULL notes line should look like:
  notes       latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136

You can now also use the custom variables "_LAT" and "_LONG" to provide the coordinates.
Your host configuration should contain:
  _LAT 66.174082
  _LONG -13.119136

You can get the precise coordinates from Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) - right click on 
the spot where your device is located and select option "What's here?". The coordinates will be set 
in maps search bar. 

To draw connections, hosts need to have 'parents' field set up in Nagios / Icinga.

Apache / Nagmap setup
=====================
Your webserver (e.g. Apache) needs to have PHP support enabled!
Please make sure your PHP is version 5.2.0 and above :) (see phpinfo() php function)

On some distributions you might need to install mbstring for PHP - like Fedora / RedHat:
yum install php-mbstring

1) copy the nagmap directory into your Apache web folder
   (/var/www/ on Debian/Ubuntu, or /var/www/html/ on RedHat/CentOS)

2) copy config.php.example into config.php and edit this file (config.php) to fit your needs

3) Open the website of nagmap installation (e.g. open Firefox - point to http://www.youwebserver.org/nagmap )

When not working as expected, send the source code of the website (Ctrl-U in Firefox) to maco@blava.net for support :) 

Livestatus-Backend Extension by Enfileyb
========================================
Currently this is optional! Livestatus is just another Backend.
But as we do not need to parse the config files, the performance should be better and any variables, that are assigned with templates e.g. are automatically available.
(Btw. you could also parse the objects.cache instead of the cfg files to get the values from templates!).

If you are already running Livestatus, eg. for Thruk / NagVis / PNP4Nagios (if you use authentication) just enable it in config.php and change the socket according to your configuration.
Otherwhise install Livestatus: http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html

If you want to use authentication, either install NagMap into the ../share folder of Nagios/Icinga or into any other folder and configure your webserver (see nagmap.httpd.conf.example).
